# Granger_Tests

In this folder are shown five Granger Tests for the time series of the Slope charts with ```maxlag``` parameter equal to 5. The test can be performed also analizing only two of the attributes of the slope charts, always considering the aggregation day by day during the elections. See script ```granger_test.py``` for more details.

It is important to notice that ```Fratoianni_GT.pdf``` is not possible to be computed because one of the attributes of the slope chart is always equal to zero, so the test cannot be performed.
